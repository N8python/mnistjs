# [2.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/compare@2.0.0) (2021-10-12)

#### üõë Breaking changes

- major update of ALL pkgs (export maps, ESM only) ([0d1d6ea](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/0d1d6ea))
- BREAKING CHANGE: discontinue CommonJS & UMD versions
  - only ESM modules will be published from now on
  - CJS obsolete due to ESM support in recent versions of node:
    - i.e. launch NodeJS via:
    - `node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --experimental-repl-await`
    - in the node REPL use `await import(...)` instead of `require()`
  - UMD obsolete due to widespread browser support for ESM
  Also:
  - normalize/restructure/reorg all package.json files
  - cleanup all build scripts, remove obsolete
  - switch from mocha to [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament) for all tests

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

- update all tests in _all_ pkgs ([8b582bc](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/8b582bc))
  - update all to use [@thi.ng/testament](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/main/packages/testament)

### [1.3.16](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/compare@1.3.16) (2020-09-13)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/compare@1.2.0) (2020-03-01)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/@thi.ng/compare@1.1.0) (2019-11-30)

- update package build scripts & outputs, imports in ~50 packages ([b54b703](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/b54b703))
- BREAKING CHANGE: enabled multi-outputs (ES6 modules, CJS, UMD)
  - build scripts now first build ES6 modules in package root, then call
    `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib`
  - all imports MUST be updated to only refer to package level
    (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of
    all unused imported symbols.
